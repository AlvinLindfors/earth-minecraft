## Getting Started

When first logging in to the server you will be prompted to choose 
between the following two options:

* Create a nation
* Join an existing one

If the Join an existing one option isn't there it means there are
no existing nations.

### Creating a nation

To create a nation you must specify upon three things:

1. A name
2. A banner design
3. An ideology

Please note that the name and idology can change under certain conditions,
the banner can not be changed unless two nations merge.
