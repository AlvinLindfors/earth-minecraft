## Getting Started

When first logging in to the server you will be prompted to choose 
between the following two options:

* Create a nation
* Join an existing one

If the Join an existing one option isn't there it means there are
no existing nations.

### Creating a nation

To create a nation you must decide upon three things:

1. A name
2. A banner
3. An ideology

Please note that while the name and ideology can be changed under certain conditions,
the banner can not be changed.

#### The Name

You can name you nation whatever you want as long as the name

* Contains only letters, spaces, numbers, apostrophes and hyphens
* Isn't something offensive
* Is less than 50 characters long (including spaces)

#### The Banner

Creating a banner can be done at [This Website](https://minecraft.tools/en/banner.php)

Don't worry about what items are needed for the banner as you won't be crafting it anyway.
You will be using the command

```
  /trigger banner
```
